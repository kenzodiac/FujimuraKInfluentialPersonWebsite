                <p><span class="title-underline">"Project-A" (1983)</span> - An action film staring Jackie Chan, and co-staring the other Three Dragons. It's about an officer in the Royal Navy in colonial Hong Kong over 100 years ago, as he and his partners are on the hunt for pirates. This was probably Jackie's first international breakout success, and the action sequences are peerless - including a legenary scene where Jackie fell from the top of a clock tower for a stunt and almost died.</p>

                <p><span class="title-underline">"Police Story" (1985)</span> - This is a bombastic modern crime drama following a police inspector as he roots out crime in ridiculous ways in the streets of Hong Kong. Some of Jackie's most incredible stunts ever were done in this movie, including one where he drives a car through a shantytown. In a modern day reading, he's almost a posterboy for ACAB, but it's a hilarious film.</p>

                <p><span class="title-underline">"Police Story 3: Super Cop" (1992)</span> - A sequel in the Police Story franchise, this one Jackie teams up with Michelle Yeoh as a joint operation between the HK police and the Chinese Miltary to hunt down Chinese Mafia smugglers. The film is balls-to-the-wall incredible action, and Michelle Yeoh steals every scene she's in, while she's at the absolute pinnacle of her abilities as a fighter.</p>

                <p><span class="title-underline">"Drunken Master II" (1994)</span> - Probably Jackie Chan's Magnum Opus. It has some truly ridiculous setpiece fights, including a fight versus 100-man axe gang. The story is about a young Wong Feihung as he fights to take back stolen cultural artifacts from greedy colonial officials of the British Empire with the power of Drunken Boxing.</p>

                <p><span class="title-underline">"Rumble in the Bronx" (1995)</span> - An over the top action film where Jackie goes to New York and fights a combo of wild street gangs, as well as an organized crime cyndicate. This was probably Jackie's breakout movie in the United States and laid the foundations for his Hollywood career.</p>
