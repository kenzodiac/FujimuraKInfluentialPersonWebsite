                <p>Growing up, Jackie Chan was a personal hero of mine. I didn't know much about his personal life/story. But his movies meant the world to me. As an Asian-Americna kid growing up in the 90s, there were few to no movie stars that looked like me. It's a pretty limiting feeling to look around and never see examples of success that you can imagine yourself as. And while I obviously could and never would be a big movie star, or a Kung Fu master, watching Jackie Chan blow every other action star out of the water while being distinctively Asian was inspiring. Lots of my peers grew up looking up to Hulk Hogan, or Arnold Schwarzenegger, or a plethora of other white movie stars. But for me, I had Jackie, and he did things in movies nobody else could. It really felt like we could accomplish anything versus being invisible in society.</p><br>
                <p>Jackie also was a pretty strong role model, at least regarding the professional aspects of his life that I was privy to as a kid. There's a myth that he does ALL of his own stunts. And while that's false, he still does a lot of them and put his body into harms way in ways that most American actors would never have the guts to do. I always thought that courage and dedication to the craft was inspirational and worth emulating. He also has a legendarily strict work ethic. Most Hollywood films will do a few takes, and then move along in order to stay with their filming schedules. Any errors or flaws in those scenes will just be fixed in post with editing, which often leaves action scenes feeling disjointed. Jackie however, will perform a scene dozens, hundreds, or potentially even thousands of times in order to get a sequence just right. It's a little bit OCD, but the results speak for themselves, and his dedication to perfection has always been a big influence of mine</p><br>
                <p>And really, his films are just very good. As a bored kid with limited media access in the 90s compared to what people enjoy today, every VHS tape was precious. And I wore down the Jackie Chan movies I had. His pre-Hollywood film style is just catnip to my personality. The mix of action and humor is just everything I want in a film. Decades later, I'm still chasing that purple dragon when I watch films, chasing the highs I felt as a kid, and never quite getting back there. They just don't make 'em like they used to.</p>
